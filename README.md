# OpenGHG Platform Streamlit Interface

This repository hosts the interface for the OpenGHG platform, designed to improve accessibility and visualization of greenhouse gas (GHG) and ozone-depleting substances (ODS) data. This project enhances the platform's usability.

## Features

### General Layout
The interface comprises a home page and five main sub-interfaces: Observation, Footprint, Flux, ModelScenario, and Unified Data Explorer. The home page provides a concise introduction and quick links to each section, equipped with thumbnail plots for a visual guide.

### Sub-interfaces
- **Observation**: Supports searching, visualizing, and analyzing observational data, with features for data smoothing and linear regression.
- **Footprint**: Enables the retrieval, visualization, and analysis of footprint data with options for interactive graphics or animations.
- **Flux**: Offers tools to explore and visualize flux and emissions estimates, emphasizing regional interaction characteristics.
- **ModelScenario**: Facilitates the creation and analysis of model scenarios, allowing comparisons between modeled and actual observational data.
- **Unified Data Explorer**: Integrates observations and footprints for combined analysis, enhancing data interaction and visualization.

## Installation on BluePebble

This setup is specifically tailored for deployment on the BluePebble server. Follow these steps to install and configure the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ruyuG/openghg-interface.git
   ```
2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   ```sh
   bash setup_script.sh
   ```
   This script automates the setup process, including environment creation and dependency installation.

## Usage

To launch the interface after installation:
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```
Access the platform via a web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Sample datasets and GIFs for demonstration.
- `image/`: Static images used within the interface.
- `pages/`: Scripts for the interface's sections.
- `Home.py`: Main entry script for the Streamlit application.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve or extend the platform's functionalities are welcome. Please submit pull requests or create issues for any enhancements or bugs.

## Python Module Update

Due to an upgrade, the Python loading for BP has changed from:

```
module load lang/python/miniconda/3.10.10.cuda-12
```

to:

```
module load languages/python/3.12.3
```

The scripts in this repository have been updated accordingly.


### Code Update Repository
The installation script for the new version now includes port forwarding and has simplified the start and stop steps. 
To avoid any impact on thesis grading, the updated code can be found in the new repository:
